In most cases, they are acting as fiduciary agents rather than principals (direct owners). The owners of shares theoretically have great power to alter the companies via the voting rights the shares carry and the consequent ability to pressure managements, and if necessary out-vote them at annual and other meetings.\n\nIn practice, the ultimate owners of shares often do not exercise the power they collectively hold (because the owners are many, each with small holdings); financial institutions (as agents) sometimes do. Institutional shareholders should exercise more active influence over the companies in which they hold shares (e.g., to hold managers to account, to ensure Board's effective functioning). Such action would add a pressure group to those (the regulators and the Board) overseeing management.\n\nHowever, there is the problem of how the institution should exercise this power. One way is for the institution to decide, the other is for the institution to poll its beneficiaries. Assuming that the institution polls, should it then: (i) Vote the entire holding as directed by the majority of votes cast? (ii) Split the vote (where this is allowed) according to the proportions of the vote? (iii) Or respect the abstainers and only vote the respondents' holdings?\n\nThe price signals generated by large active managers holding or not holding the stock may contribute to management change. For example, this is the case when a large active manager sells his position in a company, leading to (possibly) a decline in the stock price, but more importantly a loss of confidence by the markets in the management of the company, thus precipitating changes in the management team.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4578, "end_char_idx": 7228, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8d9b8bd-f1e5-48c9-9234-1a936776ddc6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8d9b8bd-f1e5-48c9-9234-1a936776ddc6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"number": 3}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Finance3.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"number": 3}, "hash": "e8bf2ac46b22fbf250cbf7c34180085912e45aabd74161b4f0dfaf2aa0859054", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "97648b43-0f3e-41d5-a8d3-9b9a604d3893", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"number": 3}, "hash": "bb85e648e5d9d30852d074a7d217b82d20785947fd3a25024b67766a3fd8fb08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cf4ab2a0-5d1f-47f3-87e5-dae9ae246c0a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "00d12b16d826782684cc128edb3326c713fe81a0139ba6eccb4e2e2bfacfe74e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Such action would add a pressure group to those (the regulators and the Board) overseeing management.\n\nHowever, there is the problem of how the institution should exercise this power.

In some cases, institutions with minority holdings work together to force management change. Perhaps more frequent is the sustained pressure that large institutions bring to bear on management teams through persuasive discourse and PR. On the other hand, some of the largest investment managers\u2014such as BlackRock and Vanguard\u2014advocate simply owning every company, reducing the incentive to influence management teams. A reason for this last strategy is that the investment manager prefers a closer, more open, and honest relationship with a company's management team than would exist if they exercised control; allowing them to make a better investment decision.\n\nThe national context in which shareholder representation considerations are set is variable and important. The USA is a litigious society and shareholders use the law as a lever to pressure management teams. In Japan, it is traditional for shareholders to be below in the 'pecking order', which often allows management and labor to ignore the rights of the ultimate owners.

Pension assets accounted for $29.9 trillion of the total, with $24.7 trillion invested in mutual funds and $24.6 trillion in insurance funds. Together with alternative assets (sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, and exchange-traded funds) and funds of wealthy individuals, assets of the global fund management industry totalled around $117 trillion. Growth in 2010 followed a 14% increase in the previous year and was due both to the recovery in equity markets during the year and an inflow of new funds.\n\nThe US remained by far the biggest source of funds, accounting for around a half of conventional assets under management or some $36 trillion.

Christians tend to follow the Biblical scripture. Several religions follow Mosaic law which proscribed the charging of interest. The Quakers forbade involvement in the slave trade and so started the concept of ethical investment.\n\nInvestment managers and portfolio structures\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the heart of the investment management industry are the managers who invest and divest client investments.\n\nA certified company investment advisor should conduct an assessment of each client's individual needs and risk profile.

The exercise of allocating funds among these assets (and among individual securities within each asset class) is what investment management firms are paid for. Asset classes exhibit different market dynamics, and different interaction effects; thus, the allocation of money among asset classes will have a significant effect on the performance of the fund. Some research suggests that allocation among asset classes has more predictive power than the choice of individual holdings in determining portfolio return. Arguably, the skill of a successful investment manager resides in constructing the asset allocation, and separating individual holdings, to outperform certain benchmarks (e.g., the peer group of competing funds, bonds, and stock indices).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 10645, "end_char_idx": 13288, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1999f245-1077-4be3-814e-f5de51c52361": {"__data__": {"id_": "1999f245-1077-4be3-814e-f5de51c52361", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"number": 3}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Finance3.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"number": 3}, "hash": "e8bf2ac46b22fbf250cbf7c34180085912e45aabd74161b4f0dfaf2aa0859054", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "85087225-491b-4496-af9e-e9ebdce2178e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"number": 3}, "hash": "dbc01a202a8d13fa14bee9a9b7a1e9c2585fb489ef759d7041b284a026498512", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "91f7fecb-1cbc-414e-a203-e697e3304dcb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5f70a879c8e48f60f6ed2dc9e162b32e8caf5fc4a26d770ced4f537905800fc3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The advisor then recommends appropriate investments.\n\nAsset allocation\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Asset allocation\n\nSee also: Portfolio optimization\n\nThe different asset class definitions are widely debated, but four common divisions are cash and fixed income (such as certificates of deposit), stocks, bonds and real estate.

For example, over very long holding periods (e.g. 10+ years) in most countries, equities have generated higher returns than bonds, and bonds have generated higher returns than cash. According to financial theory, this is because equities are riskier (more volatile) than bonds which are themselves riskier than cash.\n\nDiversification\n\n[edit]\n\nAgainst the background of the asset allocation, fund managers consider the degree of diversification that makes sense for a given client (given its risk preferences) and construct a list of planned holdings accordingly. The list will indicate what percentage of the fund should be invested in each particular stock or bond. The theory of portfolio diversification was originated by Markowitz (and many others). Effective diversification requires management of the correlation between the asset returns and the liability returns, issues internal to the portfolio (individual holdings volatility), and cross-correlations between the returns.\n\nInvestment styles\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Investment style\n\nSee also: Style investing and Style drift\n\nThere is a range of different styles of fund management that the institution can implement.

For example, growth, value, growth at a reasonable price (GARP), market neutral, small capitalisation, indexed, etc. Each of these approaches has its distinctive features, adherents, and in any particular financial environment, distinctive risk characteristics. For example, there is evidence that growth styles (buying rapidly growing earnings) are especially effective when the companies able to generate such growth are scarce; conversely, when such growth is plentiful, then there is evidence that value styles tend to outperform the indices particularly successfully.\n\nLarge asset managers are increasingly profiling their equity portfolio managers to trade their orders more effectively. While this strategy is less effective with small-cap trades, it has been effective for portfolios with large-cap companies.\n\nPerformance measurement\n\n[edit]\n\nFund performance is often thought to be the acid test of fund management, and in the institutional context, accurate measurement is a necessity. For that purpose, institutions measure the performance of each fund (and usually for internal purposes components of each fund) under their management, and performance is also measured by external firms that specialize in performance measurement.

Several other aspects are also part of performance measurement: evaluating if managers have succeeded in reaching their objective, i.e. if their return was sufficiently high to reward the risks taken; how they compare to their peers; and finally, whether the portfolio management results were due to luck or the manager's skill. The need to answer all these questions has led to the development of more sophisticated performance measures, many of which originate in modern portfolio theory. Modern portfolio theory established the quantitative link that exists between portfolio risk and returns. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) developed by Sharpe (1964) highlighted the notion of rewarding risk and produced the first performance indicators, be they risk-adjusted ratios (Sharpe ratio, information ratio) or differential returns compared to benchmarks (alphas). The Sharpe ratio is the simplest and best-known performance measure. It measures the return of a portfolio over above the risk-free rate, compared to the total risk of the portfolio. This measure is said to be absolute, as it does not refer to any benchmark, avoiding drawbacks related to a poor choice of benchmark.

It measures the return of a portfolio over above the risk-free rate, compared to the total risk of the portfolio. This measure is said to be absolute, as it does not refer to any benchmark, avoiding drawbacks related to a poor choice of benchmark. Meanwhile, it does not allow the separation of the performance of the market in which the portfolio is invested from that of the manager. The information ratio is a more general form of the Sharpe ratio in which the risk-free asset is replaced by a benchmark portfolio. This measure is relative, as it evaluates portfolio performance about a benchmark, making the result strongly dependent on this benchmark choice.\n\nPortfolio alpha is obtained by measuring the difference between the return of the portfolio and that of a benchmark portfolio. This measure appears to be the only reliable performance measure to evaluate active management. we have to distinguish between normal returns, provided by the fair reward for portfolio exposure to different risks, and obtained through passive management, from abnormal performance (or outperformance) due to the manager's skill (or luck), whether through market timing, stock picking, or good fortune. The first component is related to allocation and style investment choices, which may not be under the sole control of the manager, and depends on the economic context, while the second component is an evaluation of the success of the manager's decisions. Only the latter, measured by alpha, allows the evaluation of the manager's true performance (but then, only if you assume that any outperformance is due to the skill and not luck).\n\nPortfolio returns may be evaluated using factor models. The first model, proposed by Jensen (1968), relies on the CAPM and explains portfolio returns with the market index as the only factor. It quickly becomes clear, however, that one factor is not enough to explain the returns very well and that other factors have to be considered. Multi-factor models were developed as an alternative to the CAPM, allowing a better description of portfolio risks and a more accurate evaluation of a portfolio's performance. For example, Fama and French (1993) have highlighted two important factors that characterize a company's risk in addition to market risk. These factors are the book-to-market ratio and the company's size as measured by its market capitalization. Fama and French-, therefore proposed a three-factor model to describe portfolio normal returns (Fama\u2013French three-factor model).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 19142, "end_char_idx": 21728, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c8dc2c4-cfa6-44f5-91b4-ee69d7e906a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c8dc2c4-cfa6-44f5-91b4-ee69d7e906a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"number": 3}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Finance3.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"number": 3}, "hash": "e8bf2ac46b22fbf250cbf7c34180085912e45aabd74161b4f0dfaf2aa0859054", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "95dce97a-c9aa-4910-9031-61d67646222f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"number": 3}, "hash": "4ff048c9c51e63d6d5bbfdd397c3d63bda82500d42be781012f485a2c5f8ad04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca1af305-3e71-4e51-89d1-f6e4ebf61363", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce1b65042a8af027c987375012c3f0154e80289dbc0bf82e6532301d2ad93f4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Portfolio returns may be evaluated using factor models.

Also of interest for performance measurement is Sharpe's (1992) style analysis model, in which factors are style indices. This model allows a custom benchmark for each portfolio to be developed, using the linear combination of style indices that best replicate portfolio style allocation, and leads to an accurate evaluation of portfolio alpha. However, certain research indicates that internet data may not necessarily enhance the precision of predictive models.[8]\n\nEducation or certification\n\n[edit]\n\nInvestment management certifications Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Chartered Investment Manager (CIM) Chartered Wealth Manager (CWM) Certified International Investment Analyst (CIIA)\n\nFurther information: Financial analyst \u00a7 Qualification\n\nSee also: Professional certification in financial services \u00a7 Investments, and Outline of finance \u00a7 Education\n\nAt the undergraduate level, several business schools and universities internationally offer \"Investments\" as a subject [9] [10] [11] [12] within their degree; further, some universities, in fact, confer a specialist bachelor's degree, with title in \"Investment Management\" or in \"Asset Management\" or in \"Financial Markets\".
