In practice, risks are always present in any financial action and entities.\n\nDue to its wide scope, a broad range of subfields exists within finance. Asset-, money-, risk- and investment management aim to maximize value and minimize volatility. Financial analysis assesses the viability, stability, and profitability of an action or entity. Some fields are multidisciplinary, such as mathematical finance, financial law, financial economics, financial engineering and financial technology. These fields are the foundation of business and accounting. In some cases, theories in finance can be tested using the scientific method, covered by experimental finance.\n\nThe early history of finance parallels the early history of money, which is prehistoric. Ancient and medieval civilizations incorporated basic functions of finance, such as banking, trading and accounting, into their economies. In the late 19th century, the global financial system was formed.\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, finance emerged as a distinct academic discipline,[c] separate from economics.[1] The earliest doctoral programs in finance were established in the 1960s and 1970s.[2] Today, finance is also widely studied through career-focused undergraduate and master's level programs.[3][4]\n\nThe financial system\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Financial system\n\nSee also: Financial services, financial market, and Circular flow of income\n\nAs outlined, the financial system consists of the flows of capital that take place between individuals and households (personal finance), governments (public finance), and businesses (corporate finance). \"Finance\" thus studies the process of channeling money from savers and investors to entities that need it.[d] Savers and investors have money available which could earn interest or dividends if put to productive use.

Individuals, companies and governments must obtain money from some external source, such as loans or credit, when they lack sufficient funds to run their operations.\n\nIn general, an entity whose income exceeds its expenditure can lend or invest the excess, intending to earn a fair return. Correspondingly, an entity where income is less than expenditure can raise capital usually in one of two ways: (i) by borrowing in the form of a loan (private individuals), or by selling government or corporate bonds; (ii) by a corporation selling equity, also called stock or shares (which may take various forms: preferred stock or common stock). The owners of both bonds and stock may be institutional investors\u2014financial institutions such as investment banks and pension funds\u2014or private individuals, called private investors or retail investors. (See Financial market participants.)\n\nThe lending is often indirect, through a financial intermediary such as a bank, or via the purchase of notes or bonds (corporate bonds, government bonds, or mutual bonds) in the bond market. The lender receives interest, the borrower pays a higher interest than the lender receives, and the financial intermediary earns the difference for arranging the loan.[6][7][8] A bank aggregates the activities of many borrowers and lenders. A bank accepts deposits from lenders, on which it pays interest. The bank then lends these deposits to borrowers. Banks allow borrowers and lenders, of different sizes, to coordinate their activity.\n\nInvesting typically entails the purchase of stock, either individual securities or via a mutual fund, for example.

The main areas of personal finance are considered to be income, spending, saving, investing, and protection. The following steps, as outlined by the Financial Planning Standards Board,[10] suggest that an individual will understand a potentially secure personal finance plan after:\n\nPurchasing insurance to ensure protection against unforeseen personal events;\n\nUnderstanding the effects of tax policies, subsidies, or penalties on the management of personal finances;\n\nUnderstanding the effects of credit on individual financial standing;\n\nDeveloping a savings plan or financing for large purchases (auto, education, home);\n\nPlanning a secure financial future in an environment of economic instability;\n\nPursuing a checking or a savings account;\n\nPreparing for retirement or other long term expenses.[11]\n\nCorporate finance\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Corporate finance and Financial management\n\nFurther information: Strategic financial management\n\nCorporate finance deals with the actions that managers take to increase the value of the firm to the shareholders, the sources of funding and the capital structure of corporations, and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources.

They act as lenders of last resort as well as strong influences on monetary and credit conditions in the economy.[18]\n\nDevelopment finance, which is related, concerns investment in economic development projects provided by a (quasi) governmental institution on a non-commercial basis; these projects would otherwise not be able to get financing. A public\u2013private partnership is primarily used for infrastructure projects: a private sector corporate provides the financing up-front, and then draws profits from taxpayers or users. Climate finance, and the related Environmental finance, address the financial strategies, resources and instruments used in climate change mitigation.\n\nInvestment management\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Investment management\n\nSee also: Active management and Passive management\n\nInvestment management[12] is the professional asset management of various securities\u2014typically shares and bonds, but also other assets, such as real estate, commodities and alternative investments\u2014in order to meet specified investment goals for the benefit of investors.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 11705, "end_char_idx": 14225, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c75c090-c7ba-4581-87a4-518e6acda06d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c75c090-c7ba-4581-87a4-518e6acda06d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"number": 0}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Finance0.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"number": 0}, "hash": "789b7beac48e751e8989bfb744b4d73d2be5d3efb0234545afb046ebf2d32e64", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2c906710-098d-46fb-85b5-541ddb6faba4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"number": 0}, "hash": "94d0b28cd367bd835de796d5669ec917775f8671137f221853cdcd891b94ce7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8be7ff47-edd0-4242-b046-7d78d602d35e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f5d6b5c050836ae0900e0bcac8ffc6646ef29a2754fff6ef818cfacd60f00dac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "They act as lenders of last resort as well as strong influences on monetary and credit conditions in the economy.[18]\n\nDevelopment finance, which is related, concerns investment in economic development projects provided by a (quasi) governmental institution on a non-commercial basis; these projects would otherwise not be able to get financing.

Financial risk management[20][21] is the practice of protecting corporate value against financial risks, often by \"hedging\" exposure to these using financial instruments. The focus is particularly on credit and market risk, and in banks, through regulatory capital, includes operational risk.\n\nCredit risk is the risk of default on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments;\n\nMarket risk relates to losses arising from movements in market variables such as prices and exchange rates;\n\nOperational risk relates to failures in internal processes, people, and systems, or to external events.\n\nFinancial risk management is related to corporate finance[12] in two ways. Firstly, firm exposure to market risk is a direct result of previous capital investments and funding decisions; while credit risk arises from the business's credit policy and is often addressed through credit insurance and provisioning. Secondly, both disciplines share the goal of enhancing or at least preserving, the firm's economic value, and in this context[22] overlaps also enterprise risk management, typically the domain of strategic management. Here, businesses devote much time and effort to forecasting, analytics and performance monitoring.

The calculations here are mathematically sophisticated, and within the domain of quantitative finance as below. Credit risk is inherent in the business of banking, but additionally, these institutions are exposed to counterparty credit risk. Banks typically employ Middle office \"Risk Groups\", whereas front office risk teams provide risk \"services\" (or \"solutions\") to customers.\n\nAdditional to diversification, the fundamental risk mitigant here, investment managers will apply various hedging techniques as appropriate,[12] these may relate to the portfolio as a whole or to individual stocks.

It thus centers on pricing, decision making, and risk management in the financial markets,[31][25] and produces many of the commonly employed financial models. (Financial econometrics is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterize the relationships suggested.)\n\nThe discipline has two main areas of focus:[25] asset pricing and corporate finance; the first being the perspective of providers of capital, i.e. investors, and the second of users of capital; respectively:\n\nAsset pricing theory develops the models used in determining the risk-appropriate discount rate, and in pricing derivatives; and includes the portfolio- and investment theory applied in asset management. The analysis essentially explores how rational investors would apply risk and return to the problem of investment under uncertainty, producing the key \"Fundamental theorem of asset pricing\".

The field is largely focused on the modeling of derivatives\u2014with much emphasis on interest rate- and credit risk modeling\u2014while other important areas include insurance mathematics and quantitative portfolio management. Relatedly, the techniques developed are applied to pricing and hedging a wide range of asset-backed, government, and corporate-securities.\n\nAs above, in terms of practice, the field is referred to as quantitative finance and / or mathematical finance, and comprises primarily the three areas discussed. The main mathematical tools and techniques are, correspondingly:\n\nfor derivatives,[34] It\u00f4's stochastic calculus, simulation, and partial differential equations; see aside boxed discussion re the prototypical Black-Scholes and the various numeric techniques now applied\n\nfor risk management,[23] value at risk, stress testing and \"sensitivities\" analysis (applying the \"greeks\"); the underlying mathematics comprises mixture models, PCA, volatility clustering and copulas.[35]\n\nin both of these areas, and particularly for portfolio problems, quants employ sophisticated optimization techniques\n\nMathematically, these separate into two analytic branches: derivatives pricing uses risk-neutral probability (or arbitrage-pricing probability), denoted by \"Q\"; while risk and portfolio management generally use physical (or actual or actuarial) probability, denoted by \"P\". These are interrelated through the above \"Fundamental theorem of asset pricing\".\n\nThe subject has a close relationship with financial economics, which, as outlined, is concerned with much of the underlying theory that is involved in financial mathematics: generally, financial mathematics will derive and extend the mathematical models suggested.

Researchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing financial economics theory makes valid predictions and therefore prove them, as well as attempt to discover new principles on which such theory can be extended and be applied to future financial decisions.

It represents a branch known as econophysics. Although quantum computational methods have been around for quite some time and use the basic principles of physics to better understand the ways to implement and manage cash flows, it is mathematics that is actually important in this new scenario[41] Finance theory is heavily based on financial instrument pricing such as stock option pricing. Many of the problems facing the finance community have no known analytical solution. As a result, numerical methods and computer simulations for solving these problems have proliferated. This research area is known as computational finance. Many computational finance problems have a high degree of computational complexity and are slow to converge to a solution on classical computers. In particular, when it comes to option pricing, there is additional complexity resulting from the need to respond to quickly changing markets.

In particular, it seeks to explain how solutions to the problems faced in allocating resources through time are facilitated by the existence of capital markets (which provide a means for individual economic agents to exchange resources to be available of different points In time) and of firms (which, by their production-investment decisions, provide a means for individuals to transform current resources physically into resources to be available in the future).\"\n\nGuthmann and Dougall: \"Finance is concerned with the raising and administering of funds and with the relationships between private profit-seeking enterprise on the one hand and the groups which supply the funds on the other.
