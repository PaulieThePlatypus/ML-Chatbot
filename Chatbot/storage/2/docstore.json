see Theory of the firm and Fisher separation theorem.\n\nGiven these, there is therefore a fundamental debate relating to \"Risk Management\" and shareholder value.[5][14][15] The discussion essentially weighs the value of risk management in a market versus the cost of bankruptcy in that market: per the Modigliani and Miller framework, hedging is irrelevant since diversified shareholders are assumed to not care about firm-specific risks, whereas, on the other hand hedging is seen to create value in that it reduces the probability of financial distress.\n\nWhen applied to financial risk management, this implies that firm managers should not hedge risks that investors can hedge for themselves at the same cost.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1602, "end_char_idx": 4168, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "faf060ab-2c48-4ba8-95ed-70948a9a0aef": {"__data__": {"id_": "faf060ab-2c48-4ba8-95ed-70948a9a0aef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"number": 2}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Finance2.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"number": 2}, "hash": "cb54d4ef11ae405ffc6f6a287b76e308fa56a244d8106db06914a24f74163280", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c30f095f-af0c-48c2-8052-dc84e8f18463", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"number": 2}, "hash": "71999c1bb79566b4c43589b39634b3d724cba83309bfced7bc50df029a408539", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "38903949-4748-4e86-8fa7-3bad58ce810c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c8d5284ebb451018517beb85c8083e3d339b2e74122c04f7dd6f175854a5f76c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[13] Further, the theory suggests that (2) firm managers cannot create value for shareholders or investors by taking on projects that shareholders could do for themselves at the same cost;

Here, market risks that result in unique risks for the firm are commonly the best candidates for financial risk management.[21]\n\nApplication\n\n[edit]\n\nAs outlined, businesses are exposed, in the main, to market, credit and operational risk. A broad distinction[12] exists though, between financial institutions and non-financial firms - and correspondingly, the application of risk management will differ. Respectively:[12] For Banks and Fund Managers, \"credit and market risks are taken intentionally with the objective of earning returns, while operational risks are a byproduct to be controlled\". For non-financial firms, the priorities are reversed, as \"the focus is on the risks associated with the business\" - ie the production and marketing of the services and products in which expertise is held - and their impact on revenue, costs and cash flow, \"while market and credit risks are usually of secondary importance as they are a byproduct of the main business agenda\".

Credit risk is inherent in the business of banking, but additionally, these institutions are exposed to counterparty credit risk. Both are to some extent offset by margining and collateral; and the management is of the net-position. Large banks are also exposed to Macroeconomic systematic risk - risks related to the aggregate economy the bank is operating in[25] (see Too big to fail).\n\nThe discipline[26][27][7][8] is, as outlined, simultaneously concerned with (i) managing, and as necessary hedging, the various positions held by the institution - both trading positions and long term exposures; and (ii) calculating and monitoring the resultant economic capital, as well as the regulatory capital under Basel III \u2014 which covers also leverage and liquidity \u2014 with regulatory capital as a floor.\n\nCorrespondingly, and broadly, the analytics [27][26] are based as follows: For (i) on the \"Greeks\", the sensitivity of the price of a derivative to a change in its underlying factors; as well as on the various other measures of sensitivity, such as DV01 for the sensitivity of a bond or swap to interest rates, and CS01 or JTD for exposure to credit spread.

(See similar below re. DuPont analysis.) The numerator, risk-adjusted return, is realized trading-return less a term and risk appropriate funding cost as charged by Treasury to the business-unit under the bank's funds transfer pricing (FTP) framework;[57] direct costs are (sometimes) also subtracted.[55] The denominator is the area's allocated capital, as above, increasing as a function of position risk;[58][59][55] several allocation techniques exist.[43] RAROC is calculated both ex post as discussed, used for performance evaluation (and related bonus calculations), and ex ante - i.e. expected return less expected loss - to decide whether a particular business unit should be expanded or contracted.[60]\n\nOther teams, overlapping the above Groups, are then also involved in risk management. Corporate Treasury is responsible for monitoring overall funding and capital structure; it shares responsibility for monitoring liquidity risk, and for maintaining the FTP framework.

Here, they may likewise[96] buy a single-stock put, or sell a single-stock future. Alternative strategies may rely on assumed relationships between related stocks, employing, for example, a \"Long/short\" strategy.\n\nBond portfolios, when e.g. a component of an Asset-allocation fund or other diversified portfolio, are typically managed similar to equity above: the Fund Manager will hedge her bond allocation with bond index futures or options; with the number of contracts, a function of duration .[99][100][96] In other contexts, the concern may be the net-obligation or net-cashflow. Here the fund manager employs Interest rate immunization or cashflow matching. Immunization is a strategy that ensures that a change in interest rates will not affect the value of a fixed-income portfolio (an increase in rates results in a decreased instrument value). It is often used to ensure that the value of a pension fund's assets (or an asset manager's fund) increase or decrease in an exactly opposite fashion to their liabilities, thus leaving the value of the pension fund's surplus (or firm's equity) unchanged, regardless of changes in the interest rate. Cashflow matching is similarly a process of hedging in which a company or other entity matches its cash outflows - i.e., financial obligations - with its cash inflows over a given time horizon. See also Laddering.[101]\n\nFor individual bonds and other fixed income securities, specific credit and interest rate risks can be hedged[96] using interest rate- and credit derivatives. Sensitivities re interest rates are measured using duration and convexity for bonds, and DV01 and key rate durations generally, and an offsetting derivative-position is purchased. For credit risk,[102] sensitivities are measured via CS01, while analysts use models such as Jarrow\u2013Turnbull and KMV to estimate the (risk neutral[103]) probability of default, hedging where appropriate, usually via CDS.

Interest rate- and credit risk together, may be hedged via a Total return swap. See Fixed income analysis\n\nFor derivative portfolios, and positions, the Greeks are a vital risk management tool: as above, these measure sensitivity to a small change in a given underlying price, rate, or parameter, and the portfolio is then rebalanced accordingly[96] by including additional derivatives with offsetting characteristics, or by purchasing or selling specified units of the underlying security.\n\nFurther, and more generally, various safety-criteria may guide overall portfolio construction. The Kelly criterion[107] will suggest - i.e. limit - the size of a position that an investor should hold in her portfolio.

Inflation for example, although impacting all securities,[111] can be managed [112][113] at the portfolio level by appropriately [114] increasing exposure to inflation-sensitive stocks, and / or by investing in tangible assets, commodities and inflation-linked bonds; the latter may also provide a direct hedge.[115]\n\nIn parallel with all above,[116][117] managers \u2014 active and passive \u2014 periodically monitor and manage tracking error, i.e. underperformance vs a \"benchmark\".
