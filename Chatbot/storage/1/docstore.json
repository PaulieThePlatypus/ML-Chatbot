The function also entails the efficient and effective day-to-day management of funds, and thus overlaps treasury management. It is also involved with long term strategic financial management, focused on i.a. capital structure management, including capital raising, capital budgeting (capital allocation between business units or products), and dividend policy; these latter, in large corporates, being more the domain of \"corporate finance.\"\n\nSpecific tasks:\n\nProfit maximization happens when marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue. This is the main objective of financial management.\n\nMaintaining proper cash flow is a short run objective of financial management. It is necessary for operations to pay the day-to-day expenses e.g. raw material, electricity bills, wages, rent etc. A good cash flow ensures the survival of company; see cashflow forecast.\n\nMinimization on capital cost in financial management can help operations gain more profit.\n\nEstimating the requirement of funds:[3] Businesses make forecast on funds needed in both short run and long run, hence, they can improve the efficiency of funding.

In the context of financial management, the function sits with treasury; usually the management of the various short-term financial legal instruments (contractual duties, obligations, or rights) appropriate to the company's cash- and liquidity management requirements.
