consumer economics, were taught in various colleges as part of home economics for over 100 years.[1]\n\nThe earliest known research in personal finance was done in 1920 by Hazel Kyrk. Her dissertation at University of Chicago laid the foundation of consumer economics and family economics.[1] Margaret Reid, a professor of Home Economics at the same university, is recognized as one of the pioneers in the study of consumer behavior and Household behavior.[1][2]\n\nIn 1947, Herbert A. Simon, a Nobel laureate, suggested that a decision-maker did not always make the best financial decision because of limited educational resources and personal inclinations.[1] In 2009, Dan Ariely suggested the 2008 financial crisis showed that human beings do not always make rational financial decisions, and the market is not necessarily automated and corrective of any imbalances in the economy.[1][3]\n\nResearch into personal finance is based on several theories, such as social exchange theory and andragogy (adult learning theory).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2989, "end_char_idx": 5574, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ef0e3c9-ed44-4ecc-b06f-85ff3a96288e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ef0e3c9-ed44-4ecc-b06f-85ff3a96288e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"number": 4}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Finance4.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"number": 4}, "hash": "33da5292fe7fc30c55ab0741cdcb0edaaf4833d36120047785123545b798218a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "169858df-e6ba-413a-86ea-0870236f4d7b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"number": 4}, "hash": "1f5608f476ad2a8d9d20febc7f853dc4f2996e302b472d6afa04e12c13f2b37b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c85d904-beb2-43ce-9243-765ae415cde2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "efd4581f0b4da31a533d9c82a9f6c945a62ad8379fb4644d922927047a743e12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[1]\n\nThe earliest known research in personal finance was done in 1920 by Hazel Kyrk.

In America, professional bodies such as American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences and the American Council on Consumer Interests started to play an important role in developing this field from the 1950s to the 1970s. The establishment of the Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education (AFCPE) in 1984 at Iowa State University and the Academy of Financial Services (AFS) in 1985 marked an important milestone in personal finance history in the US. Attendances of the two societies mainly come from faculty and graduates from business and home economics colleges. AFCPE started to offered several certifications for professionals in this field, such as Accredited Financial Counselor (AFC) and Certified Housing Counselor (CHC). Meanwhile, AFS cooperates with Certified Financial Planner (CFP Board).[1]\n\nBefore 1990, the study of personal finance received little attention from mainstream economists and business faculties. However, several American universities such as Brigham Young University, Iowa State University, and San Francisco State University started to offer financial educational programs in both undergraduate and graduate programs since the 1990s. These institutions published several works in journals such as The Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning and the Journal of Personal Finance.\n\nAs the concerns about consumers' financial capability increased during the early 2000s, various education programs emerged, catering to a broad audience or a specific group of people, such as youth and women. The educational programs are frequently known as \"financial literacy\".", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4653, "end_char_idx": 7195, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c85d904-beb2-43ce-9243-765ae415cde2": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c85d904-beb2-43ce-9243-765ae415cde2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"number": 4}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Finance4.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"number": 4}, "hash": "33da5292fe7fc30c55ab0741cdcb0edaaf4833d36120047785123545b798218a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ef0e3c9-ed44-4ecc-b06f-85ff3a96288e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"number": 4}, "hash": "3a8f205795a7fdba4887d296502fa879b2d9b4d962353a78b5af3fdd446a07da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5768c43b-0982-4a91-aa0f-26869923652c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fa9056b9efa7c05b22aa8fa9465ee7ac855ca3d946d4268ba2ecba66e7c86a83", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "AFCPE started to offered several certifications for professionals in this field, such as Accredited Financial Counselor (AFC) and Certified Housing Counselor (CHC).

It also stressed the importance of developing a standard in financial education.[1]\n\nPersonal finance principles\n\n[edit]\n\nIt is hard to define universal personal finance principles because:\n\nindividual situations vary significantly when it comes to income, wealth, and consumption requirements\n\ntax and financial regulations vary between countries\n\nmarket conditions change both geographically and over time.\n\nA financial advisor can offer personalized advice in complicated situations and for high-wealth individuals.

In general, it involves five steps:[5][6]\n\nAssessment: A person's financial situation is assessed by compiling simplified versions of financial statements, including balance sheets and income statements. A personal balance sheet lists the values of personal assets (e.g., car, house, clothes, stocks, bank account, cryptocurrencies), along with personal liabilities (e.g., credit card debt, bank loan, mortgage). A personal income statement lists personal income and expenses.\n\nGoal setting: Multiple goals are expected, including short- and long-term goals. For example, a long-term goal would be to \"retire at age 65 with a personal net worth of $1,000,000\", while a short-term goal would be to \"save up for a new computer in the next month.\" Setting financial goals helps to direct financial planning by determining the parameters and expectations one aims to achieve.\n\nPlan creation: The financial plan details how to accomplish the financial goals set in the previous step.

Shortened employable age: Over the years, with the advent of automation [11] and changing needs; it has been witnessed across the globe that several jobs that require manual intervention or that are mechanical are increasingly becoming redundant.\n\nSeveral employment opportunities are shifting from countries with higher labor costs to countries with lower labor[12] costs keeping margins low for companies.\n\nIn economies with a considerably large younger population entering the workforce who are more equipped with the latest technologies, several employees in the middle management[13] who have not up-skilled are easily replaceable with new and fresh talent that is cheaper and more valuable to the organizations.\n\nCyclical nature of several industries[14] like automobile, chemicals, construction; consumption and demand is driven by the health of the countries economy.

An individual can lose their job quickly and remain unemployed for a considerable time.

Increased life expectancy:[16] With the developments in healthcare, people today live till a much older age than previous generations. The average life expectancy has increased even in developing economies. The average life expectancy has gradually shifted from 60 to 81[16] and upwards, which coupled with a shorter employable age reinforces the need for a large enough retirement corpus and the importance of personal finance.\n\n4. Rising medical expenses:[17] Medical expenses including cost of prescription medicine, hospital admission care and charges, nursing care, specialized care, geriatric care have all seen an exponential rise over the years. Many of these medical expenses are not covered through insurance policies that might either be private/individual insurance coverage or through federal or national insurance coverage.\n\nIn developed markets like the US,[18] insurance coverage is provided by either the employers, private insurers or through federal government (Medicare, primarily for senior citizens or Medicaid, primarily for individuals of lower income levels).

This leads to the national healthcare budgets being very tightly controlled. Many newer, expensive therapies are frequently excluded from national formularies.

Net worth is a person's balance sheet, calculated by adding up all assets under that person's control, minus all household liabilities, at one point. Household cash flow is the total of all the expected income sources within a year minus all expected expenses within the same year. From this analysis, the financial planner can determine to what degree and when the personal goals can be accomplished.\n\nAdequate protection: or insurance, is the analysis of how to protect a household from unforeseen risks. These risks can be divided into liability, property, death, disability, health, and long-term care. Some wagers may be self-insurable, while most require an insurance contract. Determining how much insurance to get, at the most cost-effective terms, requires knowledge of the market for personal insurance. Business owners, professionals, athletes, and entertainers need specialized insurance professionals to protect themselves adequately.

Managing taxes is not a question of whether or not taxes will be paid but when and how much. The government gives many incentives in the form of tax deductions and credits, which can be used to reduce the lifetime tax burden. Most modern governments use a progressive tax. As one's income grows, a higher marginal rate of tax must be paid. Understanding how to take advantage of the myriad tax breaks when planning one's finances can be significantly impactful.\n\nInvestment and accumulation goals: planning how to accumulate enough money for large purchases and life events is what most people consider financial planning. Significant reasons to get assets include purchasing a house or car, starting a business, paying for education expenses, and saving for retirement.\n\nRetirement planning is understanding how much it costs to live at retirement and developing a plan to distribute assets to meet any income shortfall. Methods for retirement plans include taking advantage of government-allowed structures to manage tax liability, including individual (IRA) structures or employer-sponsored retirement plans.\n\nEstate planning involves planning to disposition one's assets after death. Typically, a tax is due to the state or federal government when one dies. Avoiding these taxes means more of one's assets will be distributed to their heirs.

It is a must for every financial planner to know how much they spend before their retirement so that they can save a significant amount. This analysis is a wake-up call as many of us know our income, but very few track their expenses.\n\nRevisiting Written Financial Plan Regularly: Make monitoring a financial plan regularly a habit. An annual financial planning review with a professional keeps people well-positioned and informed about the required changes, if any, in personal needs or life circumstances. It would be best to be prepared for all the sudden curve balls life throws.\n\nEducation Planning: With the growing interest in students' loans, having a proper financial plan in place is crucial. Parents often want to save for their kids but make the wrong decisions, adversely affecting the savings. We often observe that many parents give their kids expensive gifts or unintentionally endanger the opportunity to obtain the much-needed grant.

Parents often want to save for their kids but make the wrong decisions, adversely affecting the savings. We often observe that many parents give their kids expensive gifts or unintentionally endanger the opportunity to obtain the much-needed grant.

That question is crucial for any individual as each option has pros and cons.\n\nCredit: A line of credit is the ability of a customer to receive goods or services prior to payment with the promise that the debt will be repaid in the future, often with interest and or fees.[22] Credit can be acquired through a variety of means, including unsecured debts such as personal loans, student loans, and credit cards, as well as secured debts such as car loans and mortgages. Using debt as a means to purchase goods and services brings about a variety of pros and cons that the consumer must become educated on before diving in. Some examples of the benefits of using credit are as follows:\n\nBuilding credit: A credit score is a measurement of a borrowers trustworthiness to a lender, ranging from 300-850. Improvements to one\u2019s credit score are determined by a variety of factors, including making payments on time, keeping low outstanding balances, having credit lines open for long periods of time, applications for credit accounts, and variety of accounts open. These factors help lenders to determine the amount of money and the interest rate they are willing to grant to each individual applicant.[23]\n\nBuy now, pay later: Although saving up and using cash is often the most preferable option, many people resort to credit to make purchases before they have the funds to do so.

However, a Bank of America poll found that 42% of adults were discouraged. In comparison, 28% of adults thought that personal finance is difficult because of the vast amount of online information. As of 2015, 17 out of 50 states in the United States require high school students to study personal finance before graduation.[26][27] The effectiveness of financial education on general audience is controversial. For example, a study by Bell, Gorin, and Hogarth (2009) stated that financial education graduates were more likely to use a formal spending plan. Financially educated high school students are more likely to have a savings account with regular savings, fewer overdrafts, and more likely to pay off their credit card balances. However, another study done by Cole and Shastry (Harvard Business School, 2009) found that there were no differences in saving behaviors of people in American states with financial literacy mandate enforced and the states without a literacy mandate.[1]\n\nKiplinger publishes magazines on personal finance.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 22839, "end_char_idx": 25072, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6da63596-a513-458f-acc8-b04769f4d833": {"__data__": {"id_": "6da63596-a513-458f-acc8-b04769f4d833", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"number": 4}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Finance4.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"number": 4}, "hash": "33da5292fe7fc30c55ab0741cdcb0edaaf4833d36120047785123545b798218a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "038ebecd-40fe-4007-bf32-2e514ffb58b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"number": 4}, "hash": "42705e8f35645ade75b3a9ff53e1cdc3eeac62dc1940b3998c5accd33f8a018b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2c70985f-a618-4344-8a88-2bccf29a68b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "df8eda1d16e0ace69cfa04ba802b40ed41ed1a6b43cd11a801d60757d07ac208", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In comparison, 28% of adults thought that personal finance is difficult because of the vast amount of online information.
