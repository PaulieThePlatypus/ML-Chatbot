the economy.[1] As a subject of study, it is the branch of economics which assesses the government revenue and government expenditure of the public authorities and the adjustment of one or the other to achieve desirable effects and avoid undesirable ones.[2] The purview of public finance is considered to be threefold, consisting of governmental effects on:[3]\n\nThe efficient allocation of available resources;\n\nThe distribution of income among citizens; and\n\nThe stability of the economy.\n\nEconomist Jonathan Gruber has put forth a framework to assess the broad field of public finance.[4] Gruber suggests public finance should be thought of in terms of four central questions:\n\nWhen should the government intervene in the economy? To which there are two central motivations for government intervention, Market failure and redistribution of income and wealth.[4]\n\nHow might the government intervene? Once the decision is made to intervene the government must choose the specific tool or policy choice to carry out the intervention (for example public provision, taxation, or subsidization).[5]\n\nWhat is the effect of those interventions on economic outcomes?

A question to assess the empirical direct and indirect effects of specific government intervention.[6]\n\nAnd finally, why do governments choose to intervene in the way that they do? This question is centrally concerned with the study of political economy, theorizing how governments make public policy.[7]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the more traditional subfields of economics, public finance emphasizes the function and role of government in the economy. A region's inhabitants established a formal or informal entity known as the government to carry out a variety of tasks, including providing for social requirements like education and healthcare as well as protecting the populace's private property from outside threats.\n\nThe proper role of government provides a starting point for the analysis of public finance. In theory, under certain circumstances, private markets will allocate goods and services among individuals efficiently (in the sense that no waste occurs and that individual tastes are matching with the economy's productive abilities). If private markets were able to provide efficient outcomes and if the distribution of income were socially acceptable, then there would be little or no scope for government. In many cases, however, conditions for private market efficiency are violated. For example, if many people can enjoy the same good (the moment that good was produced and sold, it starts to give its utility to every one for free) at the same time (non-rival, non-excludable consumption), then private markets may supply too little of that good. National defense is one example of non-rival consumption, or of a public good.[8]\n\n\"Market failure\" occurs when private markets do not allocate goods or services efficiently.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6363, "end_char_idx": 9014, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea3273fa-4b47-489d-837f-c08bdfaecd81": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea3273fa-4b47-489d-837f-c08bdfaecd81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"number": 5}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Finance5.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"number": 5}, "hash": "a6244d5abd0cffccc64ce5943fcd36ef05b7a959c75cd3fc43ad7b5e4555351b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc5e7269-9749-4bfd-b56c-649dc35588d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"number": 5}, "hash": "b1d13d33186f5dd857ab2f67b35d7493ffa3cbc2f1dc55fb5ce344271c1b036b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c0244b26-3caf-48eb-8f02-d19c3cb9c939", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6be881426d6c1293f44e9285a23df699931e9218be796fdc0626055dc3219cd4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The proper role of government provides a starting point for the analysis of public finance.

The existence of market failure provides an efficiency-based rationale for collective or governmental provision of goods and services.[9] Externalities, public goods, informational advantages, strong economies of scale, and network effects can cause market failures. Public provision via a government or a voluntary association, however, is subject to other inefficiencies, termed \"government failure.\"\n\nUnder broad assumptions, government decisions about the efficient scope and level of activities can be efficiently separated from decisions about the design of taxation systems (Diamond-Mirrlees separation). In this view, public sector programs should be designed to maximize social benefits minus costs (cost-benefit analysis), and then revenues needed to pay for those expenditures should be raised through a taxation system that creates the fewest efficiency losses caused by distortion of economic activity as possible.

There is also a difference between public and private finance, in public finance the source of income is indirect, e.g., various taxes (specific taxes, value added taxes), but in private finance sources of income is direct.[10]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough public finance only began to be viewed as a body of knowledge no more than a century and a half ago, there is evidence of principles common to public finance as early as the bible with discussions of Sunday-trade, slavery regulations, and compassion for the poor. Public finance, although not explicitly named, is often the subject of much of political philosophy.\n\nThese concepts can be seen in ancient greece as well, although it was split into two categories there: on one hand the government was to provide for a theater in every city and works of art in the country side. On the other hand, the government was to provide financing for war. Unemployment in ancient Greece was virtually non-existent as Greek economic rule equated heavily to slavery. Greek economic development as per the governmental duties extended to growth, equity, and employment.\n\nThe Romans later popularized systemic bodies of law. They guaranteed freedom of contract and property, as well as reasonable price and value. They also developed a well-maintained system of roads and colonies which led to one of the first real tax systems. Their system was tbased on two types of taxes: tributa and vectigalia.

Other taxes depended entirely on the city and were usually temporary. These taxes were used among other things to fund the military, establish trade routes, and fund the cursus publicum. Each region had a set amount to pay which would be collected by aristocrats. Who paid taxes was determined by local officials. The Romans employed a regressive tax system wherein the lower income levels paid higher taxes and the wealthier enjoyed reduced taxation.[11]\n\nDuring feudalism lacking communication led to issues with pre-existing tax systems. Taxation was organized based on what \"men spend\" in hopes of encouraging investment and savings. Since the government was meant to take care of those who would otherwise turn to charity or crime by means of an allowance provided by a public tax, it is one of the first concepts of what could be considered a negative income tax. Additionally, in England at the time, the main taxes paid were land taxes, a tax that was collected in order to pay for mercenaries.

Later in the eighteenth and nineteenth century lords began having to pay a per capita tax for each of their peasants and were responsible for their well-being during times of famine.\n\nToward this time, public finance and interest in how governments were to utilize the money earned from taxes as well as how to provide for their state became increasingly common.\n\nThe laissez-faire approach first became popular toward the middle of the 17th century, popularized especially by Charles Davenant. The laissez-faire attitude was especially common with Physiocrats in France (as opposed to the classical school in Britain). They maintained a \"laissez-faire, laisser-passer\" attitude, with one of the central ideas being that the government's central role should be to guarantee private property, and the maintenance of one single tax, namely the produit net, which encompassed the farmer's surplus.\n\nAdam Smith also advocated for the laissez-faire attitude, but also claimed that the government would need to take a more proactive role in protection, justice, and public works.

Adam Smith also maintained that a government should maintain a properly regulated money flow and banking system, patents as well as copyrights, and provide public education and transport.

Government operations have the power to make, and the authority to enforce rules and laws within a civil, corporate, religious, academic, or other organization or group.[14]\n\nIncome distribution\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Income distribution\n\nSee also: Redistribution (economics)\n\nIncome distribution \u2013 Some forms of government expenditure are specifically intended to transfer income from some groups to others. For example, governments sometimes transfer income to people that have suffered a loss due to natural disaster. Likewise, public pension programs transfer wealth from the young to the old.

Its significance arises not only from the fact that it is by far the most important of all revenues but also because of the gravity of the problems created by the present day tax burden.[15] The main objective of taxation is raising revenue. A high level of taxation is necessary in a welfare State to fulfill its obligations. Taxation is used as an instrument of attaining certain social objectives, i.e., as a means of redistribution of wealth and thereby reducing inequalities. Taxation in a modern government is thus needed not merely to raise the revenue required to meet its expenditure on administration and social services, but also to reduce the inequalities of income and wealth. Taxation might also be needed to draw away money that would otherwise go into consumption and cause inflation to rise.[16]\n\nA tax is a financial charge or other levy imposed on an individual or a legal entity by a state or a functional equivalent of a state (for example, tribes, secessionist movements or revolutionary movements).

Government debt (also known as public debt or national debt) is money (or credit) owed by any level of government; either central or federal government, municipal government, or local government. Some local governments issue bonds based on their taxing authority, such as tax increment bonds or revenue bonds.\n\nAs the government represents the people, government debt can be seen as an indirect debt of the taxpayers. Government debt can be categorized as internal debt, owed to lenders within the country, and external debt, owed to foreign lenders. Governments usually borrow by issuing securities such as government bonds and bills. Less creditworthy countries sometimes borrow directly from commercial banks or international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank.\n\nMost government budgets are calculated on a cash basis, meaning that revenues are recognized when collected and outlays are recognized when paid. Some consider all government liabilities, including future pension payments and payments for goods and services the government has contracted for but not yet paid, as government debt. This approach is called accrual accounting, meaning that obligations are recognized when they are acquired, or accrued, rather than when they are paid. This constitutes public debt.\n\nSeigniorage\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Seigniorage\n\nSeigniorage is the net revenue derived from the issuing of currency.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 21222, "end_char_idx": 23626, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7f862a1-f12b-4833-baef-9e5b52193fd5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7f862a1-f12b-4833-baef-9e5b52193fd5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"number": 5}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Finance5.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"number": 5}, "hash": "a6244d5abd0cffccc64ce5943fcd36ef05b7a959c75cd3fc43ad7b5e4555351b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce2b6299-784c-40bb-93c7-4eefab657a69", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"number": 5}, "hash": "b8ce269bdb7e0811bece8ff52ed4d4df71f0f3c37103962ab34555ca3f7d42fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "17671a57-fa5c-4ab2-9ffb-52a99cee0a77", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "659001f12743b863d596bcb6c5992f4126559711b660bb4e8cebff419364bf2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Government debt can be categorized as internal debt, owed to lenders within the country, and external debt, owed to foreign lenders.

It arises from the difference between the face value of a coin or banknote and the cost of producing, distributing and eventually retiring it from circulation.

The GFSM 2001 provides a blueprint for the compilation, recording, and presentation of revenues, expenditures, stocks of assets, and stocks of liabilities. The GFSM 2001 also defines some indicators of effectiveness in government's expenditures, for example the compensation of employees as a percentage of expense. The GFSM 2001 includes a functional classification of expense as defined by the Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG) .\n\nThis functional classification allows policy makers to analyze expenditures on categories such as health, education, social protection, and environmental protection. The financial statements can provide investors with the necessary information to assess the capacity of a government to service and repay its debt, a key element determining sovereign risk, and risk premia. Like the risk of default of a private corporation, sovereign risk is a function of the level of debt, its ratio to liquid assets, revenues and expenditures, the expected growth and volatility of these revenues and expenditures, and the cost of servicing the debt. The government's financial statements contain the relevant information for this analysis.\n\nThe government's balance sheet presents the level of the debt; that is the government's liabilities. The memorandum items of the balance sheet provide additional information on the debt including its maturity and whether it is owed to domestic or external residents. The balance sheet also presents a disaggregated classification of financial and non-financial assets.\n\nThese data help estimate the resources a government can potentially access to repay its debt.

Mostly, this will involve progressive taxations in which higher earners pay a higher rate.\n\nUniform resource distribution: It ensures that public services across regions are of high quality and equal, including those from the less wealthy areas. This approach helps to mitigate regional disparities in access to government services.\n\nUniversal access to services: These policies are put in place to make sure that all citizens have access to some of the essential public services. For example, among the services ensuring the well-being and economic productivity of people are primary education, healthcare, and public safety.\n\nAnti-discrimination measures: To enforce policies meant for the prevention of discrimination in the distribution of services and employment within the government sector. That is necessary in a society where people have an equal chance to succeed.\n\nImplementation strategies\n\n[edit]\n\nTo achieve social equality, governments employ a variety of strategies, including:\n\nPolicy evaluation and adjustment: Evaluation of the influence behind fiscal policies on the different demographic groups. Implemented to guarantee that said policies are effective.\n\nPublic engagement: In this way, the process includes diverse community stakeholders to ensure they contribute and their needs are also addressed in the policies.\n\nLegislative reforms: Laws that support equitable access to resources and protect against discrimination in public service delivery.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 32287, "end_char_idx": 35079, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77541934-404e-4d95-bd75-e4a484f088cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "77541934-404e-4d95-bd75-e4a484f088cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"number": 5}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Finance5.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"number": 5}, "hash": "a6244d5abd0cffccc64ce5943fcd36ef05b7a959c75cd3fc43ad7b5e4555351b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d0daa42-f4bd-4333-b3cf-0d3c1cb8ca18", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"number": 5}, "hash": "c34bc23e7e726b22f8466bb16c5c211d2a30becf69f7e54b8897c4ed5c9a491e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d234270-2276-4201-8e19-bac3a315b807", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9e0100685fb27ce00dae10fe547692c15b92749ad0e487b6310b28be9812ec18", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Universal access to services: These policies are put in place to make sure that all citizens have access to some of the essential public services.

This idea is very relevant for designing and implementing public policies, notably towards issues such as taxation, budget allocations, and public spending.\n\nConcepts and implementation\n\n[edit]\n\nSocial equity requires formulating fiscal policies that are not only fair but also inclusive across all groups of society.

This achieved through techniques such as the \"veil of ignorance,\" which would be applied to make sure that policy makers design systems without any bias based on their personal characteristics, such as race, income, or place of residence.

Success, on the other hand, calls for involvement from the stakeholders and effective governance that takes into account long-term planning and sustainability.[31]\n\nMeasuring Social Equity\n\n[edit]\n\nClear goals have to be set with regard to measuring social equity and also relevant metrics.
